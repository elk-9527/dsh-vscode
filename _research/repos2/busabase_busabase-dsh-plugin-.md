# Give DeepSeek Harness a Knowledge Base and Database

`@busabase/dsh-plugin` connects [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) to [Busabase](https://busabase.com/), so an Agent can read trusted knowledge, work with structured data, and submit every proposed write for human review.

It gives the Agent durable context beyond one chat without giving it permission to silently rewrite your source of truth.

## See it in action

Watch DeepSeek Harness use the plugin to create a CRM AirApp, submit changes for review, and open the result in Busabase.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- A current DeepSeek Harness release compatible with this package's peer dependencies;
- Node.js `>=24.18.0`;
- pnpm available on `PATH`.

Local Busabase does not need to be running before installation. In Local mode, the plugin starts `busabase@latest` on demand or reuses a healthy Busabase Personal Desktop or local server. Cloud mode connects to the hosted service through browser OAuth.

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add @busabase/dsh-plugin
```

The package activates both the Host and Web sides automatically. Its reviewed Skills are already included in the npm package, so installation does not need lifecycle-script approval. For installation verification, updates, removal, and notes about older releases, see [Install and manage the npm bundle](DEVELOPMENT.md#install-and-manage-the-npm-bundle).

### 2. Choose Local or Cloud

- **Local** is the zero-configuration default. Use it for on-device data, an account-free setup, or Busabase Personal Desktop.
- **Cloud** is for an existing Busabase account, team workspaces, and access across devices. Add this item to `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml` (`~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml` by default):

```yaml
- id: busabase
  config:
    baseUrl: https://busabase.com
    serverName: busabase
```

Append the item if the file already has other rows. Do not put credentials in the file; DeepSeek Harness stores the OAuth grant in its credential store after browser sign-in. See the [complete Local and Cloud setup guide](https://busabase.com/docs/deepseek-harness-plugin) for updating, verification, switching modes, and troubleshooting.

### 3. Start DeepSeek Harness

```bash
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh --profile web
```

If `dsh` is installed globally, you can use `dsh` instead of `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh`. Open `http://127.0.0.1:3080/`. Local mode waits until Busabase is needed. Cloud mode opens the browser for OAuth on the first start, then reuses the stored grant later.

### 4. Try a first task

```text
Create a customer follow-up Base with company, contact, stage, expected deal size,
owner, next action, and follow-up date. Submit the structure for my review.
```

In Local mode, call `busabase_start` first if the full MCP tool catalog is not visible. In Cloud mode, complete browser authorization before submitting the task. The Agent checks the existing workspace first and proposes the Base as a ChangeRequest. You inspect the diff and decide whether to approve and merge it; Cloud proposals are reviewed through their canonical Busabase links.

## Why use it

Chat context is useful for the current task, but it is a poor long-term data system. Important conclusions become hard to reuse, business objects lack structure, and an Agent mistake can pollute a document or database before anyone notices.

This plugin adds four things to DeepSeek Harness:

- **Trusted knowledge:** search approved Docs, Files, Bases, Records, comments, and related objects;
- **Structured work:** turn natural-language requests into proposed Bases, Forms, AirApps, and records;
- **Useful results:** render Busabase entities as conversation cards with a live Inspector instead of raw JSON;
- **Human control:** keep Agent writes at `changeRequest` permission and, by default, require a fresh confirmation for review actions.

```text

                ↓
@busabase/dsh-plugin connects the Agent to Busabase
                ↓
Busabase stores approved knowledge and structured data
```

## Common workflows

- **Team knowledge:** answer questions from approved product docs, meeting decisions, research, and FAQs with locatable sources.
- **Research synthesis:** extract evidence, themes, and priorities from interviews, then review the proposed records before merging.
- **Business databases:** describe a CRM, project tracker, inventory, recruiting pipeline, or operations ledger in natural language.
- **Content operations:** prepare reviewable articles, social posts, newsletters, SEO pages, and localization records.
- **Data cleanup:** propose deduplication, tagging, enrichment, classification, matching, or translation in batches.
- **Workspace apps:** build Forms and AirApps around canonical Busabase data and preview them inside the Inspector.

For example:

```text
Look up the latest enterprise data-retention policy in our knowledge base.
Give me the source document and propose updates for any conflicting FAQ records.
```

The Agent can read the approved policy and prepare corrections, but it cannot approve its own changes.

## Approval-first by design

```text
A regular database
Agent ──writes directly──► official data
                           the mistake is already live

Busabase
Agent ──proposes──► ChangeRequest ──human review──► canonical data
                    the mistake is still a proposal
```

The MCP connection is capped at `changeRequest`. Busabase rejects Agent attempts to approve, reject, close, or merge, including proposals that request `autoMerge: true`. Inspector review actions require a new, explicit user confirmation by default, and stored workspace content is treated as data rather than instructions. Confirmation prompts can be disabled in advanced configuration, but doing so does not raise the Agent's server-enforced permission.

## Configuration

The defaults connect to Busabase at `http://localhost:15419`, start or reuse a loopback service on demand, enable live Inspector refresh, and require confirmation for review actions.

To use another address, adjust plugin load order, or tune server and refresh behavior, see the [full configuration reference](DEVELOPMENT.md#full-configuration-reference).

### Connecting to Busabase Cloud

Override the Bundle row by `id` and point `baseUrl` at an `https://` Busabase Cloud address (a root-host deployment, optionally with `spaceId`, or a workspace subdomain) to connect there instead of a local server:

```yaml
- id: busabase
  config:
    baseUrl: https://busabase.com
    serverName: busabase
```

The plugin never manages or starts a remote server. When the remote plugin loads for the first time, it opens your OS browser for a standard OAuth sign-in; DeepSeek Harness stores the resulting token through its credential store, not in this configuration. The MCP connection still sends a fixed `changeRequest` permission ceiling. In this release the Inspector's review, merge, live refresh, and embedded Base/AirApp previews stay local-only: use the canonical Busabase Cloud link the Inspector shows to inspect, review, and merge remotely.

## Current boundaries

- The default setup targets a single local Busabase workspace;
- A non-loopback `baseUrl` is treated as an external service in `auto` mode and is never started by the plugin;
- Connecting to a non-loopback `https://` `baseUrl` uses browser-based OAuth instead of the local relay, and keeps Inspector review, merge, and live refresh local-only;
- The full MCP tool set becomes available after `busabase_start` starts the service and reconnects (local mode only);
- The Agent can propose changes but cannot perform final review or merge;
- Base and AirApp previews require compatible same-origin and embed-origin settings;
- Disabling an iframe keeps entity metadata and the "Open in Busabase" entry available.
