A persistent **project development memory** for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (dsh) agents. Built specifically for project development, natively integrated with dsh's task system: task lists and files read during a session are automatically persisted as cross-session task records, with tasks ↔ files linked — workflows can be switched and resumed, no need to re-scope the whole project, solving context loss. Documents (PDF/Markdown/txt) and code symbols are stored separately per workspace; documents are automatically cross-linked to the code symbols they mention. Experience notes (problem → solution) are automatically deduplicated, preventing repeated mistakes. All data is stored per project on disk, survives session compaction and handover; recalls include `path:line` citations for source verification. Only one dependency, no vector DB, no native builds.

> The plugin keeps a compact project **memory** on disk, with every entry pointing to a concrete file and line — the agent can reorient quickly instead of re-reading the whole project. Tasks and experience persist across session compactions and handovers.

The workflow panel is collapsible, automatically adapts to dsh and theme plugin styles, and offers four card style options to switch between.

## Features

- **TaskBridge: cross-session development tasks** — the plugin watches each session's live todo list (`todo_write` events) and file reads (`tool/call`): progress snapshots (`steps`) and touched files sync into durable per-project task entities. An unbound session that writes a todo auto-creates a task. Associated files are kept in **recency-weighted order (written/edited first; a read never outranks a written file)** so a resumed session sees at a glance where to look. New sessions continue by `list_tasks` → `select_task` (bind / rename / unarchive); `query_memory` gains `type: 'task'` and appends a task-count hint to `type: 'all'` results. The user-side `/tasks` command shows the task stack, step progress, involved files, and the current session binding. A task named by the model via `select_task(title=…)` keeps that title; one **auto-created** by the first `todo_write` is titled from its **first list entry** (≤48 chars), falling back to the first human message (the part after the last colon), then `Untitled Task`. Sessions spawned as **subagents** are excluded from auto-creation (`origin: 'subagent'` / `delegationDepth > 0`); merging delegated work back into a task is deliberately unbuilt — see §11 in Design tradeoffs. Capacity is project-size adaptive (`fileCount/20`, clamped 5–100). Storage: `.dsh-project-memory/tasks.json` + `binding.json`. Auto-sync requires a dsh build with session events + `todo_write` (verified on 0.1.2-alpha.x, re-verified against the 0.1.5-rc.1 host surface); on older hosts the task tools still work as a plain record list.
- **Task Panel (v0.4.2+): Floating task panel in dsh web** — built on the real dsh web 0.1.5-rc.1 client plugin contract (cordis inject + apply, registered into host `shell.overlay` slot). Draggable cards show steps/files (click to copy path); collapse to a draggable mini-bar; hide completely (summon with `/task` / `/tasks`). Render errors have error boundaries — panel crash no longer takes down the host.
- **Task Panel Behavior** —
  - **Default hidden**: panel does not show on dsh web startup
  - **Explicit summon**: type `/tasks` or `/task` (list form) to open; model calls `show_task_panel` tool to open
  - **Session switch**: only syncs data in background, **does not** auto-open panel
  - **Page refresh**: panel stays hidden (UI state `closed` not persisted)
  - **Manual close**: click × to fully hide (no mini-bar); reopen requires explicit summon
  - **Collapse to mini-bar**: click ↓ to keep draggable top bar; click bar to expand
  - **Hide hints**: click ? to suppress every hover tooltip in the panel (drag handle, style/view/minimize/close, rename, step status, copy path, mini-bar, memory view); the preference is stored in localStorage and survives a refresh; the button dims while hints are off — click again to restore
- **Bidirectional task-list sync (host ↔ plugin tasks, v0.4.2+)** — `select_task` or `/task switch` pushes task steps to host `todo/write` so dsh's rendered task list mirrors the plugin's task entity. Config `tasklist.syncHostOnAdopt` (default on) to toggle. Empty `todo/write` means "clear": unbound session clears list without creating junk tasks; bound session clears that task's steps (task retained). Panel edits (step text/status) = write back bound task + push host list, sharing one code path with model `todo_write`. `/task` subcommands: `switch`, `archive`, `unbind`, `rename`, `todos` (invoked by panel buttons/clicks, not the model); `unbind` also clears the host task list above the input.
- **Panel editing & themes (v0.4.2+)** — bound cards: double-click title/step for inline edit (input auto-grows); click step status icon to cycle todo→in-progress→done. Non-bound cards read-only. **Four visual themes** (click folder icon left of title, persisted locally): Native / Glassmorphism / Brutalist / Terminal monospace — only material, geometry, typeface, density change; colors always use dsw alias tokens, follow host light/dark and theme plugins.
- **Document memorization** — PDF, Markdown, and plain text files are chunked and summarized **without any model call**: each entry keeps a ≤300-character `summary` for injection, a bounded (≤160) deterministic, stop-word-filtered `terms` set that covers the **entire chunk** (search-only, so recall is not limited to the opening lines), and a `path:line` citation back to the source. The legacy `blindSpots` field is always empty now that indexing never calls a model; it is kept only so stores written by older versions still load.
- **Code symbol memory (L1 regex)** — a dependency-free scanner extracts functions, classes and methods with full signatures (generics, parameter/return types, overloads) plus interfaces and type aliases across 8 languages, producing one-line identity signatures `fn(a: A, b: B): R — file.ts:42`. It masks strings/comments, joins multi-line signatures, is indentation-aware for Python and carries class-method context — with zero LLM tokens.
- **Optional TypeScript semantic enhancement (L2/L3)** — when `typescript` is installed in the user project (`npm i -D typescript`), the plugin automatically activates a second layer (L2) that uses the TS Compiler API to infer return types, resolve generics, extract interfaces and type aliases, and enrich arrow functions — all asynchronously in a priority queue (P0 on `fs/observed`, P1 on `watch`, P2 on `index_repo`). Results are cached on disk keyed by file content hash (L3) for instant cold-start reuse. Zero config: just install TS (5.x or 6.x) and restart dsh. Fully optional; if TS is absent or disabled via `enableTypeScript: false`, the plugin falls back to L1 regex-only extraction.
- **Automatic refresh** — a background poll (`watch_repo`) detects new or changed files by content hash and re-memorizes only those.
- **Read-time memorization** — files are memorized the moment the model actually reads them (`fs/observed`), so the memory is a byproduct of normal work, not a separate upfront scan. Files that are never read are never indexed. The project root is detected by markers (`.git`, `package.json`, …), a README plus source directories, or the file's own directory as a last resort.
- **Doc ↔ code cross-linking** — when a document mentions a symbol, the match is recorded as a `reference`; querying a symbol also surfaces the documents that describe it.
- **BM25 memory recall** — ranked search over documents, symbols, and experience notes, with optional LLM query expansion to handle vocabulary mismatch. **CJK-optimized**: precise phrase boost (3+ char phrases ×1.5 score on title/keywords match), synonym table (e.g. 数据库连接池 ↔ 连接池 ↔ DB pool), and CJK-aware word boundaries for doc↔symbol linking.
- **Experience notes** — problems → solutions; similar problems supersede instead of duplicating, and notes are returned only when a search matches. The note store is bounded: capacity scales with project size (clamped to 100–2000), and the oldest notes are pruned when the limit is exceeded. **Supersede tightened to bidirectional 0.7 overlap** (was 0.6); **experience `problem` field now participates in CJK phrase boost** for long-tail query recall.
- **v0.5 tiered insight memory (lessons / decisions / procedures)** — one `insight` entity across three scopes: `task` (private drafts in `tasks.json`), `project` (`.dsh-project-memory/insights.json`), `global` (`~/.config/dsh-project-memory/global.json`). `save_lesson` writes any scope; dedupe is bidirectional token overlap ≥ 0.7 (merge) with a 0.65–0.7 reinforce band; **promotion is a scope change, not a copy** — 2 tasks hitting the same insight promote it to project, 3+ to global. Archive is soft (`archived`), decay/capacity prune archived entries only; writes are filtered for secret/token-shaped content. LLM **reflection is off by default** and only ever writes task-level drafts (`source: reflect`) on task switch-away/archive. Panel gains a Task / Project / Global memory view with approve, promote/demote, archive/restore, delete, edit and a create form (procedures can carry an “as Skill” trigger). Old `experience.json` notes are imported into `insights.json` once, non-destructively. Every kind can carry an authored `trigger` (`keywords` / `symbols` / `actions` / `paths`): a hit injects the entry **before the action**, deterministically — procedure-only in v0.5, all kinds since the readiness layer.
- **Streaming TF + IDF caching** — query path caches IDF (term inverse frequency) per store version; on cache hit, single-pass streaming scores 20k entries (5k files) in p50 2.6 ms / p95 5.4 ms — and 4k entries (1k files) in p50 0.6 ms / p95 1.6 ms — with zero intermediate objects. Only a **dirty** write bumps the version and drops the cache — a no-op `save()` returns before touching the disk, so the 15 s watch poll can never clear the cache a query just built.
- **Lock-free sync transactions** — all writes (index / watch / remember / forget / watch_repo) go through synchronous transactions `store.commit(fn)`; fn succeeds then atomic write; the JS single-threaded event loop guarantees no interleaving (**in-process only** — see Consistency); `remember`/`forget` are never blocked by watch re-indexing.
- **Minimal dependencies** — pure JavaScript; the only runtime dependency is `pdfjs-dist` (PDF text extraction), no native builds required.
- **Negligible overhead** — pure in-process operation; a 5k-file store loads in 40 ms, and a cached query over 20k entries is p50 2.6 ms / p95 5.4 ms (4k entries: p50 0.6 ms / p95 1.6 ms); the bottleneck is PDF extraction and disk I/O, not the plugin's scoring.

## Performance

### Synthetic Benchmark (Node 24.19, WSL2 on 20 vCPU, Linux file system)

| Scenario | Scale | Measured |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Full cold index | 5,000 files / 20k entries | 269 ms avg (p50 267) |
| Cold load | 5,000 files | 40 ms |
| Hot lazy re-index (single file) | 5k files | p50 2.4 ms / max 5.5 ms |
| query_memory (cached) | 5k files / 20k entries | p50 2.6 ms / p95 5.4 ms |
| query_memory (cached) | 1k files / 4k entries | p50 0.6 ms / p95 1.6 ms |
| Full cold index | 10,000 files / 40k entries | 551 ms avg (p50 528) |
| Cold load | 10,000 files | 90 ms |
| Hot lazy re-index (single file) | 10k files | p50 5.4 ms / max 9.2 ms |

> Synthetic benchmark: generated code (~4–5 symbols/file), Node 24.19 on WSL2 / 20 vCPU / Linux file system, measured 2026-09-14. Reproduce with `npm run bench:synthetic -- 5000` (harness: `scripts/bench-synthetic.mjs`). Measures pure indexing overhead without LLM calls. query_memory uses the IDF cache + precomputed searchText; the first query after a write rebuilds IDF (**106 ms at 40k entries**, 57 ms at 20k, 12 ms at 4k), subsequent queries hit the cache.

### Real Project Storage

| Project | Files | Entries | Store Size | Per Entry |
|---------|-------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Java Spring Boot backend | 1,254 | 7,335 | 6.7 MB | ~0.9 KB |
| Vue 3 + Vite frontend | 289 | 2,141 | 1.0 MB | ~0.5 KB |

> Real projects (Java + Vue), tested on Linux file system (Node 24). Real project entries are smaller than synthetic benchmarks due to lower symbol density and shorter declarations.

### Reproduce it on your own project

Rather than asking you to trust the numbers above, the measurement itself ships with the repository **and with the published npm package** (`scripts/` is part of the tarball). It needs **no dsh instance, no network and no model calls**, and it never touches your project's own store — results go to a temp directory and are removed when it finishes:

```bash
npm run bench -- /path/to/your/project
# or, with options:
node scripts/bench.mjs /path/to/your/project [--json] [--samples 100] [--no-pdf] [--keep]
```

It reports the cold index split into read+hash / extract / commit, cold load, IDF rebuild, cold and hot query latency (p50/p95/max over 100 sampled queries through the shipped scorer), single-file hot re-index, store size and bytes per entry. Example — our internal Vue project (289 files / 2,141 entries, Node 24, 20 CPU, Linux):

```
cold index   253 ms   (read+hash 9 ms · extract 229 ms · commit 13 ms)   ← 2nd, warm-cache run
store        1.10 MB · 538 bytes/entry · cold load 4.6 ms
hot query    p50 0.80 ms · p95 1.35 ms          (2,141 entries)
re-index 1 file  p50 0.33 ms
```

Two caveats we would rather state than hide: `read+hash` depends on the OS page cache — on that corpus the first run spent 787 ms and the second 253 ms, so say which run you quote — and **real projects score slower than the synthetic table above** — on a 3,000-file slice of a large TypeScript repository (15,594 entries) hot queries were p50 7.5 ms, because real declaration text is longer than generated stubs. Pass `--queries your-queries.json` to run the same labeled-set method (hit@5 / hit@10 / MRR) against your own project.

## How it works

The design follows four principles:

- **Volatility** — context is ephemeral; it is lost when a session is compacted.
- **Persistence** — the **memory** is stored on disk and survives compaction and new sessions.
- **Compactness** — the code layer stores one declaration line per symbol, so code-heavy projects stay near **0.5% of the source** (8.8 MB of source → 49 KB of index in the example project), and **recall** replaces re-reading the full file. The document layer is heavier by design: each chunk keeps a ≤300-char injected `summary`, a bounded `terms` set covering the whole chunk for retrieval, and a precomputed `searchText`. Measured on a docs-only corpus (179 chunks / 225 KB of Markdown): `terms` ≈ **27.5%** of source and the on-disk store ≈ **166%** of source — so on doc-heavy projects budget for roughly the docs themselves, not 0.5%.
- **Verifiability** — **recalls** carry a `path:line` citation where applicable, so the agent can confirm details against the source.

Building the **memory** does not require an upfront scan: files are memorized as the model reads them, so the **memory** grows to cover exactly what has been worked with. Re-reading a file that has not changed is a no-op (content hash), so the **memory** stays fresh with minimal ongoing overhead.

The store is per-project and follows the codebase: changed files are re-extracted by content hash, deleted files are removed. Experience notes are retrieval-only, so accumulation does not affect context.

## Installation

The plugin relies exclusively on stable public APIs (`defineTool`, `llm.stream`, `Schema`) declared via peerDependencies, ensuring compatibility with future rc/alpha releases without changes.

```bash
cd dsh-project-memory && dsh plugin --profile web add . -w
```

The `-w` (workspace-root) flag is required: the profile directory is a pnpm workspace root, and pnpm rejects `add` there without it. From any other directory, the path form works the same: `dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-project-memory -w`.

The plugin is also published on npm as a scoped package:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add @yolk_vat-y/dsh-project-memory -w
```

A prebuilt tarball is published with each release, installable without a build step:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-project-memory.tgz
```

Each indexed project has its own store at `<root>/.dsh-project-memory/`. Add it to `.gitignore` if it should not be committed.

## Usage

The tools below are **invoked by the agent**, not typed by the user. In the chat, just ask naturally — e.g. "index this project" or "what does the auth module do?" — or simply keep working, and the agent calls the matching tool automatically. By default (`lazyIndexing`) files are indexed the moment the model reads them, so memory fills in while you work. `watch_repo` keeps explicitly-watched roots fresh in the background; `index_repo` forces a full backfill of a project (unchanged files are skipped).

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index_doc file_path` | Index one document (PDF/MD/txt): chunk → deterministic `summary` + whole-chunk `terms` → store with `path:line`. Unchanged files are skipped. |
| `index_repo root` | Index a whole project: docs get deterministic summaries + whole-chunk terms, code files get a zero-token symbol table. Incremental, cleans up deleted files, cross-links docs to symbols. A root that does not exist — including a Windows-style path resolved on Linux/macOS — is rejected before anything is written. |
| `watch_repo root` | Enable automatic refresh: a background poll detects new/changed files (mtime + content hash) and re-indexes only those. Watched roots persist across plugin restarts; a non-existent root, the filesystem root and the shared temp directory are all refused, and roots that disappear are dropped instead of being re-created. |
| `memory_stats root` | Show what the store contains: totals (files / entries / experience notes), last index time, and the per-file list sorted by recency. |
| `query_memory query` | BM25 search over docs + symbols + experience + insights (lessons / decisions / procedures), optionally query-expanded by the LLM. `type` selects a layer (`all` / `doc` / `symbol` / `experience` / `insight` / `task`). Returns ranked hits with relative scores, sources or insight ids, and doc→symbol references. |
| `list_tasks` | List task records for the project (archived marked). Call first in a new session before continuing work. |
| `select_task` | Bind the session to a task so its todo list and file reads sync into it. Exact `taskId`, or exact `title` (multiple matches return candidates; no match creates a new task). Pass `title` with `taskId` to rename. Auto-unarchives. |
| `archive_task` | Archive a task (hide from default views, exclude from capacity, stop syncing). `select_task` restores it. |
| `show_task_panel` | Show the task panel in the UI. Call when the user asks to see the task list or when you want to display the panel. |
| `/tasks` (typed by the user, not the model) | Shows the task stack: title, step progress, involved files, and which task the current session is bound to. |
| `/task` (typed by the user, not the model) | Task panel subcommands: `switch` / `archive` / `unbind` / `rename` / `todos`. Invoked by panel buttons/clicks; does not go through the model. |
| `/insight` (typed by the user, not the model) | v0.5 memory view actions (panel buttons): `list [task|project|global]`, `confirm` / `promote` / `demote` / `archive` / `restore` / `delete` `<scope> <id>`, `save <scope> <json>`, `edit <scope> <id> <json>`. |
| `remember problem solution` | Save an experience note. Similar problems supersede instead of duplicating. |
| `forget id_or_query` | Delete stale experience notes. |
| `save_lesson` (agent tool) | Save a lesson/decision/procedure at task/project/global scope (single insight entity). Near-duplicates merge (≥ 0.7 overlap) or reinforce (0.65–0.7); 2+ tasks hitting the same insight auto-promote task → project, 3+ → global. Params: `title`, `kind`, `scope`, `pattern`/`fix` or `choice`/`reason` or `steps`, `trigger` (`keywords`/`symbols`/`actions`/`paths`/`scope` — any kind; a hit injects the entry before the action), `task_id`, `files`, `symbols`, `confidence`, `root`. |

## Design

```
.dsh-project-memory/
  format.json      layout marker (v2, sharded)
  shards/          one self-describing JSON per indexed source file
                    ({ relPath, record, entries }) — writes touch only dirty shards
  experience.json  problem → solution notes (retrieval-only)
  watch.json       watched roots
  tasks.json       TaskBridge task entities (cross-session)
  binding.json     current session ↔ task binding
  insights.json    v0.5 project-scope insights (lessons/decisions/procedures); v0.4 experience notes imported once, non-destructively
```

Stores created before v0.2.0 (single `entries.json` / `index.json`) migrate automatically and idempotently on first load. Within one dsh process, all tool calls share a single in-memory store per project, so hot-path indexing writes only the shard that changed.

- **Incremental** — content hash per file; only changed files are re-extracted.
- **Cross-linking** — after indexing, doc summaries are matched against symbol names; matches are attached to the doc entry as `references` and surfaced by `query_memory`.
- **Query expansion** — when `llmQueryExpansion` is on, `query_memory` asks `ctx.llm` to rewrite the query into several variants (synonyms, EN/CN, identifier guesses) and merges BM25 scores across variants; when off, queries never touch the LLM. Indexing itself is model-free: keywords are rule-derived (title-weighted top terms), and doc↔symbol links surface English symbol names from Chinese hits.
- **Consistency** — the fact layer follows the codebase (hash re-extract / remove-on-delete); the experience layer is retrieval-only with supersede and `forget`. Store writes are serialized per memory directory; the lock is in-process, so avoid running multiple dsh instances against the same project store concurrently.

## Architecture (Task Panel)

```
TaskPanel (Container)
├── task-data-store  (server data, cross-tab sync via BroadcastChannel)
├── task-ui-store    (local UI state, localStorage)
├── task-hooks       (useTaskDrag, useTaskEdit)
└── TaskComponents   (MiniBar, TaskCard — presentational only)
```

## Design tradeoffs

These are deliberate scope choices.

### 1. Synchronous lock-free transactions over async locks

**We do:** All writes go through `store.commit(fn)` — a synchronous in-process transaction. The callback `fn` performs all validation and mutations; only on success is the result atomically written to disk. The JS event loop guarantees no interleaving. CAS (`applyFileUpdate`) makes concurrent writes idempotent.

**We don't:** Async mutexes, file locks, or multi-process coordination.

**Why:** DSH runs on Cordis, which is single-process by design. Adding locks would complicate the hot path (every `remember`/`forget`/`index_doc` call) for a scenario (multi-process DSH) that would require a breaking ecosystem change. Synchronous transactions keep the hot path at ~2 ms median with zero contention overhead in practice.

### 2. Watch: compute outside, commit inside

**We do:** Heavy work (mtime/hash/scan/parse/PDF extraction) runs outside the transaction; a single `commit` applies all changes atomically. On failure, the snapshot rolls back so the next poll retries automatically.

**We don't:** Hold a lock during parsing, or use `fs.watch` events.

**Why:** PDF extraction and large-file parsing take time — holding a lock would block `remember`/`forget`/`query_memory`. Polling with mtime+content-hash is platform-agnostic (works on network drives, Docker volumes, WSL) and avoids the "double fire / missed events" nightmare of `fs.watch`.

### 3. Corrupt files are quarantined, not auto-repaired

**We do:** On JSON parse failure, the bad file is renamed to `*.corrupt`, an error is logged, and that file's store starts fresh. The rest of the store remains intact.

**We don't:** Write-ahead logs, embedded databases (SQLite/LMDB), or automatic partial recovery.

**Why:** A corrupted shard means *one source file* has a bad index — quarantining it costs near zero. A WAL or embedded DB adds a heavy dependency, increases binary size, and introduces new failure modes (lock contention, corruption of the WAL itself). The tradeoff: lose one file's index vs. add 500 KB+ of native code.

### 4. No vector embeddings, no semantic search at query time

**We do:** BM25 with CJK phrase boost (3+ chars ×1.5 on title/keywords), synonym expansion (bidirectional table), field weighting (title ×5), and experience-layer phrase boost. All at query time, zero LLM calls.

**We don't:** Vector embeddings, dense retrieval, rerankers, or hybrid search.

**Why:** Vectors require an embedding model (local = heavy, remote = latency + cost + privacy), a vector index (HNSW/IVF = memory + build time), and reranking (another LLM call). For the queries this plugin targets, lexical BM25 is already sufficient and measurable: on our benchmark suite (29 queries over a real Vue project) file-level hit@5 is **96.6%**, and 28 of the 29 are exact symbol lookups that lexical search answers essentially always. Whole-chunk `terms` took document-term coverage from **27.3% to 100%** while queries that already worked kept their ranking (MRR **0.958** vs **0.955**). Those figures come from an internal Vue project with a hand-labeled 29-query set, so they are not reproducible outside it — but the **method** now ships as `scripts/bench.mjs --queries <your-set.json>`, so you can run the identical measurement on your own project. The marginal gain from semantic search doesn't justify the 10x complexity/cost increase.

### 5. Indexing is deterministic and model-free

**We do:** Derive keywords with a rule (title-weighted top terms) and build a whole-chunk `terms` set — both deterministic and reproducible. Doc↔symbol links surface English symbol names from Chinese queries, and CJK tokenization keeps cross-language hits working. With `llmQueryExpansion: false`, queries never touch the LLM.

**We don't:** Call a model at index time to translate or paraphrase a document, and we don't translate queries at search time.

**Why:** An index-time model call makes indexing slower, non-deterministic and unverifiable — the same document can index differently on two runs. Query-time translation adds latency and a hard failure mode (a bad translation means zero recall). Rules plus symbol linking cover the common cases, work offline, and keep indexing at zero model calls.

### 6. Model-facing memory: the agent writes, and no human has to be in the loop

**We do:** Treat the agent as a first-class writer. `remember` / `save_lesson` write **any scope at any time** (`task` / `project` / `global`) with no human step, and promotion is deterministic and runs inside the ordinary write path: cross-task token-overlap dedupe accumulates `sourceTaskIds`, then `promoteAllTasksToProject` / `promoteProjectToGlobal` move an entry up once its corroboration counts are met (≥2 tasks for project, ≥ `globalPromoteTasks` — 3 by default — for global). Nothing waits on the task panel: a user who never opens the UI still gets a memory that fills, dedupes and graduates.

**We do (labeling):** Keep inferred content distinguishable from recorded content. The v0.5 `reflection` path (opt-in, **off by default**) is the only writer that infers rather than records: it writes task-scoped drafts stamped `draft: true` / `source: 'reflect'`, and `recall` plus silent injection skip `draft` entries while they remain drafts.

**We don't:** Require human approval for memory to become useful, or make the UI a step in the write path. `draft` is a **provenance label plus a corroboration threshold**, not an approval queue.

**Why:** The agent is the consumer and it is usually headless — memory that only graduates when a human clicks a card is memory that never graduates. Labeling keeps the useful half of the caution (inferred ≠ recorded, and unreviewed single-task inference stays out of the prompt) without taxing the normal path. A draft graduates on corroboration: a second task matching it through the model's own writes, or the model writing the same knowledge at project scope, which links the existing entry instead of duplicating it.

### 7. Full entries returned directly

**We do:** `query_memory` returns complete entries with `path:line` citations. Every hit can be verified against source.

**We don't:** Return a minimal index first, then require a second tool call for details.

**Why:** Returning full entries preserves **verifiability** — the agent sees the exact source line for every claim. It also avoids a round-trip per useful hit. Our entries are already compact (~300-char summary + citation, plus a search-only `terms` field that never enters the prompt); the token cost is lower than a second tool call + context switch.

### 8. Symbol extraction focused on what developers search for

**We do:** Regex-based symbol extraction (functions, classes, methods, interfaces, type aliases) with string/comment masking, multi-line signatures, and cross-file linking by symbol name. For TypeScript/JavaScript projects, an optional L2 enhancement layer uses the TS Compiler API to infer return types, resolve generics, and extract interfaces — all cached by content hash for instant reuse.

**We don't:** Tree-sitter AST parsing, import graphs, call graphs, or full-program type resolution across files.

**Why:** Our regex scanner handles 8 languages with zero dependencies, runs in <1 ms/file, and captures the declarations developers actually search for (names, signatures, generics). The optional TS layer adds semantic depth for TS/JS without native deps. Cross-file linking by name covers the most common "find related code" use case. Full-program analysis would add native binaries, 10x install size, and version fragility — for marginal gain on the remaining 5% of edge cases.

### 9. `forget` by query is aggressive; prefer ID deletion

**We do:** `forget query` deletes all experience notes with ≥0.5 token overlap.

**We don't:** Interactive confirmation, soft-delete/trash, or exact-match-only.

**Why:** Experience notes are low-stakes, high-volume, and retrieval-only. Aggressive deletion prevents stale noise from polluting search. For precision, delete by ID (shown in `query_memory` output).

### 10. TypeScript enhancement is optional, lazy, and cached

**We do:** L2 TS Compiler API enhancement runs async in a priority queue (P0 on `fs/observed`, P1 on `watch`, P2 on `index_repo`), results cached by content hash in `type-cache/`. Zero config — just `npm i -D typescript@5` or `typescript@6`. Falls back to L1 regex if TS absent or disabled.

**We don't:** Mandatory TS, blocking enhancement, or full-program type checking.

**Why:** Mandatory TS would break installs for non-TS projects. Blocking enhancement would stall `index_repo` on large codebases. Full-program checking is 10x slower and memory-heavy. Our design: enhance what's read, cache it, never block the hot path.

### 11. Subagent sessions are out of scope for now

**We do:** Exclude sessions spawned as subagents (`origin: 'subagent'` / `delegationDepth > 0`) from auto-creating or binding a task. Their `todo_write` events do not create tasks, and they inherit no task binding.

**We don't:** Merge a delegated run's steps and files back into the task that spawned it. That is **not designed yet**: there is no parent-link model for delegated work, and the naive version mints one project task per subagent.

**Why:** Every subagent that writes a todo would otherwise create its own task entity, so one fan-out run would flood the task list with ephemeral entries nobody resumes. Excluding them keeps the task list equal to the work the user actually owns. The cost is that a delegation's progress is invisible in the task record; merging it properly (child steps folded into the parent, or a separate delegated-work view) is future work.

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `memoryDir` | `.dsh-project-memory` | store directory inside each indexed root |
| `chunkChars` | 3000 | max chars per document chunk |
| `maxChunksPerFile` | 40 | max chunks per document |
| `maxFileSizeMb` | 50 | skip documents (incl. PDF) and code files larger than this (MB) |
| `maxOutputChars` | 8000 | cap for `query_memory` result text (chars) |
| `tasklist.enabled` | true | enable TaskBridge auto-sync (task entities from the session todo list and file reads) |
| `tasklist.syncHostOnAdopt` | true | when `select_task`/`/task switch` binds a task, push its steps to host `todo/write` so dsh's task list mirrors the task |
| `maxPdfPages` | 1000 | PDF page cap when pages are not otherwise limited |
| `llmQueryExpansion` | false | expand queries via `ctx.llm` before BM25 (off by default to save tokens) |
| `expansionCount` | 6 | max expansion variants |
| `lazyIndexing` | true | index files the moment the model reads them (`fs/observed`) |
| `autoIndexOnFirstUse` | false | full scan of the current working directory on plugin load (opt-in) |
| `watch` | true | enable the background refresh |
| `watchInterval` | 15 | poll interval (seconds) |
| `tsPath` | (auto) | optional absolute path to a specific `typescript` install; if omitted, resolves from project cwd → plugin node_modules |
| `enableTypeScript` | true | set `false` to disable L2 TS enhancement entirely (L1 regex only) |
| `insight.*` | dedupOverlap `0.7` · reinforceBand `0.65` · maxProject `100` · maxGlobalProcedures `200` · promoteConfidence `0.7` · globalPromoteTasks `3` · decayDays `90` · `globalFile` (auto) | v0.5 insight dedupe / reinforce / promotion / capacity / archive settings |
| `reflection.enabled` | false | v0.5 LLM reflection, **draft-only at task level** (fires on task switch-away / archive). `cooldownMs` `1800000`, `maxLessonsPerReflect` `3`, `maxDecisionsPerReflect` `2` |
| `autoContext.enabled` | true | v0.5 silent injection wrapper (entry block + relevance). Inert (full passthrough) until the host exposes a resolvable session cwd; `maxTokens` `400`, `editedMax` `3` (how many recently-written "editing now" files the resident task card shows), `signalMinRatio` `0.5` (a hint must reach half of its layer's top score), `skipEchoSelfTodo` `true` (don't echo the task card back when the model itself maintains the task list with no newer human message; relevant insights still inject), `budgetLog` `off` (budget-drop audit on stderr: `off` silent / `once` at most one line per session / `all` one line per changed dropped set. Injection is priority-scheduled, so dropping low-priority entries when the budget runs out is **normal degradation, not a failure** — hence the default keeps the user's terminal clean), `reinjectItemsAfter` `0` (cooldown, in pre-steps, before the same insight may be injected again; `0` = an unchanged item is never re-injected in the same session, because the injected message stays in the session history) |

### Toggling features

The two most relevant switches are `lazyIndexing` (index a file the moment the model reads it; default on) and `autoIndexOnFirstUse` (full scan of the current working directory on plugin load; default off). Lazily indexed project roots are automatically registered with the watcher, so changed files stay fresh without an explicit `watch_repo`.

Settings live in the plugin's config object. To change them, add an override entry to your profile's `cordis.patch.yml` — for the web profile that is `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- id: project-memory
  config:
    lazyIndexing: true          # on: index files as the model reads them (default)
    autoIndexOnFirstUse: false  # off: no upfront full scan (default)
    llmQueryExpansion: false    # off: do not spend tokens on LLM query expansion (default)
    watch: true                 # on: background refresh for watched roots (default)
    watchInterval: 15           # poll interval in seconds
    enableTypeScript: true      # on: L2 TS enhancement when TS is installed (default)
    # budgetLog: once           # debugging: log budget drops to stderr (default off = silent)
    # reinjectItemsAfter: 20    # debugging: allow the same insight again after N steps (default 0 = once per session)
    # tsPath: /custom/path/to/typescript  # optional: force specific TS install
```

Only list the keys you want to change; the rest fall back to the plugin defaults. Verify the result with `dsh --profile web --dump-config`.

For a one-off run without editing the profile, pass the override as a CLI patch overlay:

```bash
dsh web --patch ./config.yml
```

where `config.yml` contains the same override block.

## Development (for contributors)

These commands are for **maintaining the plugin code** — regular users do not need them. Installing the plugin only requires the command in [Installation](#installation).

```bash
npm install
npm test          # 286 tests (184 core + 16 TaskBridge + 11 insight-store + 9 insight-actions + 8 doc-index + 7 auto-inject + 9 host-contract + 5 reflection + 4 llm-route + 2 client-hints + 8 recall + 13 readiness + 6 insight-derive + 4 readiness-eval)
npm run bench -- /path/to/project   # index/query performance on any project — no dsh needed
```
